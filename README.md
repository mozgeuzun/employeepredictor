# Introduction

Employee attrition, also known as turnover, refers to the process of employees leaving an 
organization and being replaced by new hires. High levels of employee attrition can have 
negative impacts on a business, including increased costs for recruiting and training new 
employees, reduced productivity and customer satisfaction, and lower morale among 
remaining employees. Therefore, understanding the factors that contribute to employee 
attrition and developing strategies to prevent it is important for businesses to maintain a 
stable and productive workforce.
My Dataset is “ [Employee Attrition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/HRAnalyticRepository/employee-attrition-data) ” which shows employees that are active 
and those that terminated in 10 years. To acquire the dataset for my employee attrition data 
science project, i accessed it through the Kaggle API. Kaggle is a popular platform for data 
scientists and machine learning practitioners to find and share datasets, as well as participate 
in data science competitions.
The purpose of this project is to determine if individual terminations can be predicted from 
the data provided so that human resources of the business would take required actions. 
Overall, my data science project on employee attrition can provide valuable insights and 
recommendations for businesses looking to reduce turnover and improve the stability and 
productivity of their workforce.

# Conclusion

In summary, the main objective of this project was to identify key factors that contribute to 
employee attrition in a company and develop a model to predict employee turnover. To 
achieve this, I first performed a thorough data exploration and preprocessing phase to 
understand the characteristics of the dataset and prepare it for modeling.
During the modeling phase, i evaluated several classification algorithms including logistic 
regression, 5-fold cross validation, and random forest. Ultimately, the random forest model 
performed the best, with a testing accuracy of 1.0.
The results of my analysis suggest that the most important factor in predicting employee 
attrition is the reason for leaving the company, followed by age, length of service, and job 
title. These findings have practical implications for businesses looking to reduce employee 
turnover, as they can focus on improving retention strategies such as offering career 
advancement opportunities or addressing specific issues that may be causing employees to 
leave. This could include offering more competitive benefits, improving the company culture, 
or addressing specific issues that are causing employees to leave. Additionally, the company 
could consider implementing interventions or programs specifically targeted at improving 
retention among employees with certain characteristics, such as those with shorter lengths 
of service or certain job titles.

One limitation of this analysis is that it is based on a single company's data, and may not be 
generalizable to other organizations. Additionally, my model only predicts employee 
turnover, and does not provide information on how to prevent it. It is also important to note 
that the results of this project may be specific to the particular dataset and industry in 
question, and further research may be necessary to determine the generalizability of these 
findings to other businesses and focus on developing a more comprehensive model that 
includes both prediction and prevention strategies for employee attrition.
